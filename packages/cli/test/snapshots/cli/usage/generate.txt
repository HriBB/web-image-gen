  Generate responsive images and importable code manifests.                     
                                                                                
  Images will be generated to requested sizes and formats in the `static`       
  folder. Already existing images will be skipped, by default.                  
                                                                                
  Manifests will be generated as importable code in the `src/lib` folder.       
  Manifests are created if any new images are generated, by default.
